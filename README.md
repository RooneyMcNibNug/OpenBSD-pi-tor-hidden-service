# Hosting an OpenBSD Hidden Service on a Raspberry Pi with OpenBSD

Its the Year of ~Linux on Desktop~ Tor on Pi! Let's do it with  our favorite pufferfish üê°

---

### Downloading OpenBSD

You can head over to www.openbsd.org to do this - any one of the [mirrors](https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html) available on there will have an `.img` file of the architecture you need - which, for the raspberry pi, is the `arm64` image.

So go to something like https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.3/arm64/ (or whatever the latest version number is for you as of reading this, replacing the URL accordingly) and download the `miniroot73.img` file, which is nice and small.

### Imaging OpenBSD on a microSD

This guide assumes you have a *nix machine or Windows with [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) installed.

‚ö†Ô∏è BE CAREFUL / BE SURE THAT YOU ARE IMAGING TO THE CORRECT DISK, AS NOT TO WIPE YOUR PRIMARY OS OR ANYTHING ELSE ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Installing tor and setting up the hidden service

## "Alright, what can I do with this thing?

### Serving up a site with HTTPD

### using the server as a unix ssh box over tor

```
user@remote_pc:~ $ torsocks ssh user@[site].onion
The authenticity of host ‚Äò[site].onion (127.42.42.0)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:blahblahblah.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added ‚Äò[site].onion' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
user@[site].onion's password:

Welcome to OpenBSD: The proactively secure Unix-like operating system.

Please use the sendbug(1) utility to report bugs in the system.
Before reporting a bug, please try to reproduce it with the latest
version of the code.  With bug reports, please try to ensure that
enough information to reproduce the problem is enclosed, and if a
known fix for it exists, include that as well.

openbsdeez$
```

### hosting a git repo

Download arm64 img
Install with GPIO pins and
Install non-root user
Install all sets
Setup doas for non-root user
Get things updated: systpatch, pkg_add -u
pkg_add -i tor torsocks vim exfat-fuse htop
mkdir Documents && cp /etc/tor/torrc home/user/Documents/torrc.backup
Uncomment the tor dir lines and port 80 lins
